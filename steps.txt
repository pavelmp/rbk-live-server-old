https://medium.com/@bobtodski/installing-mysql-on-mac-88d39eea8bfd

Steps:
1) "brew install mysql" - to install
"brew services start mysql" - to launch mysql server
(optional) "mysql -uroot" - to enter mysql terminal
(optional) "mysql_secure_installation" - to change password

2) Download Sequel Pro GUI and connect to DB
If you get the error:
"Authentication plugin 'caching_sha2_password' cannot be loaded: dlopen(/usr/local/mysql/lib/plugin/caching_sha2_password.so, 2): image not found"

Then go to terminal and enter mysql, then in mysql:
"ALTER USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';"

where username is your mysql username (by default, you can use "root") and password is your root password which
is empty by default
